= Modelling Sub Types with Neo4j

A commonly asked question is how to model sub types in a graph so this project shall aim to answer that question!

== The Data

Our data set is a link:http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/animaltag-data?page=20[list of animals processed by Animal Services] in Louiseville, Kentucky.

=== Importing into Neo4j

First we need to unpack the animal data set:

[source, bash]
----
tar -xzf data/Animal_Tag_DATA.tgz -C data
----

which should leave us with a CSV file in the data directory:

[source, bash]
----
ls -alh data/

total 507696
